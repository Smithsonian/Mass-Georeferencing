# Global Lakes and Wetlands Database: Large Lake Polygons (Level 1)

>The Global Lakes and Wetlands Database was developed through a partnership among WWF, the Center for Environmental Systems Research, and University of Kassel, Germany. It draws upon the best available maps, data and information to display lakes and wetlands on a global scale (1:1 to 1:3 million resolution). The application of GIS functionality enables the generation of a database which focuses in three coordinated levels on (1) large lakes and reservoirs, (2) smaller water bodies, and (3) wetlands.
